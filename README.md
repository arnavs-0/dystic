```

```

## Usage

```sh

```
Search for jobs through the homepage, enter your job description, job location, and disibilities. Build a resume here: [Dystic Resume Builder](dystic-test.web.app), contribute to the project here on [GitHub](https://github.com/arnavs-0/dystic-resume)


**Note**
To use the job search, you must run the API locally! Check it out [here](https://github.com/arnavs-0/dystic-api/)
If you receive an error while searching for jobs, that generally means there is a captcha blocking the request. As a workaround go to Indeed's website and finish the captcha challenge. Currently, our job search only supports areas within the US.

## Future Plans

* First of all we want to make the website responsive. Although we use Bootstrap, we used a lot of custom SCSS which is not mobile optimized

* Get an Accessibility score of 100! (Currently at 98 on web.dev)

* Implement a better API without the use of Indeed

* and more!

## Issues

* Job search not available outside of US
* Chatbot is buggy with unknown responses
* Not Responsive
* Locally hosted API is required
