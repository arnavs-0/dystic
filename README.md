Search for jobs through the homepage, enter your job description, job location,
and disibilities. Build a resume here:
[Dystic Resume Builder](https://dystic-test.web.app), contribute to the project
here on [GitHub](https://github.com/arnavs-0/dystic-resume)

**NOTE** To use the job search, you must run the API locally! Check it out
[here](https://github.com/arnavs-0/dystic-api/) If you receive an error while
searching for jobs, that generally means there is a captcha blocking the
request. As a workaround go to Indeed's website and finish the captcha
challenge. Currently, our job search only supports areas within the US.

## Future Plans

- First of all we want to make the website responsive. Although we use
  Bootstrap, we used a lot of custom SCSS which is not mobile optimized

- Get an Accessibility score of 100! (Currently at 98 on web.dev)

- Implement a better API without the use of Indeed

- and more!

## Issues

- Job search not available outside of US
- Chatbot is buggy with unknown responses
- Not Responsive
- Locally hosted API is required
